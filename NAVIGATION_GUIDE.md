Complete guide to how Eline navigates through your storybook.

## 📖 Navigation Flow

### **Starting the Journey**

```
Lock Screen (Password)
    ↓ Enter "Fest"
Page 1: Cover "Voor Eline"
    ↓ Swipe left
Page 2: Bento Menu "Hoofdstuk 1" ⭐
    ↓ Tap any memory card
Pages 3-11: Memory pages
    ↓ Swipe left/right OR tap "Menu"
Back to Page 2: Bento Menu
```

## 🎯 Navigation Options

### **From Bento Menu (Page 2)**

**Option A: Start from beginning**
- Tap Card #1 (with START badge)
- Opens "Het Eerste Bericht" (page 3)
- Swipe left → Goes through memories 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 in order
- After memory 10 (Valentine's Day) → Swipe to epilogue (page 13)

**Option B: Jump to any memory**
- Tap Card #5 (Oudjaarsavond)
- Opens that memory (page 7)
- Swipe left → Continues to 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
- Swipe right → Goes back to 4, 3, 2, 1

**Option C: Revisit a favorite**
- Tap any card to jump directly there
- Read/view that memory
- Tap "Menu" button (top left) → Back to bento menu

### **From Memory Pages (Pages 3-11)**

**Top Left: Menu Button**
- Tap to return to bento menu
- **This is the ONLY way back to bento from memories**
- Always available on memory pages

**Left/Right Arrows (sides)**
- Tap to navigate between memories
- Only show when there's a valid next/previous memory
- Maintains the story order
- **Primary navigation method for memories**

**Swipe Gestures**
- **DISABLED on all memory pages** for reliability
- Use arrow buttons instead (← →)
- Swipe still works on Cover and Epilogue pages

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### On Bento Menu
- **START badge** - First memory (red badge, top right)
- **Numbers 1-9** - Order indicator (top left of each card)
- **Icons + emoji** - Visual identity
- **Gradient colors** - Each memory is unique

### On Memory Pages
- **"Menu" button** - Top left (← Menu)
- **Arrow buttons** - Left/right sides (when available)
- **Page dots** - Bottom center (shows position)
- **Active dot** - Wider dot = current page

## 🔄 Navigation Patterns

### Linear Reading (Recommended First Time)
```
Cover → Bento Menu → Memory 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 (Valentine's!) → Epilogue
```

### Random Access (Revisiting)
```
Cover → Bento Menu → Tap Memory 5 → Read → Menu → Tap Memory 8 → Read
```

### Sequential from Any Point
```
Cover → Bento Menu → Tap Memory 3 → Swipe to 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10
```

## 🎯 Smart Navigation Features

### **Jump In Anywhere, Continue in Order**
- Tap memory #4 → You're at page 6
- Swipe left → Goes to page 7 (memory #5)
- Swipe left → Goes to page 8 (memory #6)
- Navigation continues in story order

### **Always Can Go Back**
- Memory pages have "Menu" button
- Returns to bento menu
- From there, can go back to cover (swipe right)

### **Future: Multiple Chapters**
When you add Hoofdstuk 2, 3, etc.:
- Each chapter gets its own bento menu
- Navigate between chapters via their menus
- Same pattern for each chapter

## 📱 Mobile Gestures

### Swipe
- **Natural book feel** - Swipe like turning pages
- **Threshold: 25% screen width** - Must swipe far enough
- **Smooth animations** - 300ms transitions
- **Locked chapters** - Vibrates, shows alert

### Tap
- **Bento cards** - Tap to jump to memory
- **Navigation buttons** - Tap for precise control
- **Menu button** - Quick return to menu

## 🎨 For Different Screen Sizes

- **Mobile (< 400px)** - 2 column grid, comfortable cards
- **Tablet** - Same layout, bigger cards
- **Desktop** - Centered, maintains mobile feel

## 🔑 Key Navigation Rule

### **Button Navigation on Memories**

**Within Memory Sequence (Memory 1-10):**
```
Arrow Buttons (← →) = Navigate between memories
Menu Button = Exit back to bento menu
Swipe = DISABLED (prevents accidents)
```

**Why This Design?**
- **Reliable**: Arrow buttons work perfectly every time
- **No accidents**: Can't accidentally swipe out of story
- **Clear intent**: Menu button is a conscious choice to leave
- **Mobile-friendly**: Large, easy-to-tap arrow buttons
- **Scrollable content**: No conflict between scroll and swipe

**Example Flow:**
```
Memory 1 → Tap right arrow → Memory 2 → Tap right arrow → Memory 3
                ↓ (swipe disabled)
         Tap "Menu" button
                ↓
           Bento Menu
```

## 💡 UX Philosophy

### First Time Experience
1. Password creates anticipation
2. Cover sets the mood
3. Bento menu shows scope (10 memories!)
4. START badge guides her
5. Linear flow tells the story chronologically
6. Memory #10 is the Valentine's surprise finale!

### Revisiting
1. Already unlocked, goes straight in
2. Can jump to favorite memories
3. Can re-read in any order
4. Menu always accessible

## 🔮 Future Enhancements Ideas

- Progress indicator showing which memories have been read
- Favorite/bookmark memories
- Search memories by date
- Timeline view option
- Gallery view of all photos
